    whoami.toString > $user
    copy from C:\user\$user\Documents, Pictures, Desktop,

 - after it is copied to flash drive, it must have another .exe to click to copy TO the new computer from the flash drive
 - requires two .bat executables, one to copyFrom (from old PC to USB drive) and one to copyTo (from USB to new PC)
